# App Engine Modules or Service in Android Studio
This is an example project to run multiple modules (services) in Google App Engine in Android Studio

The reason I created this project is because I didnt found a single and simple project to run multiple backends (Services or Modules) In Android Studio. Google has an example for IntelJ but is very poorly documented and explained.

So I created this project so you can see how to setup a new Service or Module for Google App Engine. Using gradle and Android Studio.
